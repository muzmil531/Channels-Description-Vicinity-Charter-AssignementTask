        <h2>AfterPosten NEWS</h2>
        <p>Aftenpostenis Norway's largest printed newspaper by circulation. It is based in Oslo. It had a circulation of 211,769 in 2015 (172,029 printed copies according to University of Bergen[2]) and estimated 1.2 million readers.[3] It converted from broadsheet to compact format in March 2005.[4][5] Aftenposten's online edition is at Aftenposten.no.

                Aftenposten is a private company wholly owned by the public company Schibsted ASA.[6] Norway's second largest newspaper, VG, is also owned by Schibsted. Norwegian owners held a mere 42% of the shares in Schibsted at the end of 2015;[7] Aftenposten is thus foreign-owned.</p>
